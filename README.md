# Algorithms and Data Structures III Practical Works
The repository containts my Algorithms and Data Structures III practical works. These assignments cover a wide range of topics, including Backtracking, Graph Modeling, Flow Networks, and their corresponding test cases/suites.

## Practical Work 1, The description and solution of the assignment:
- [Assignment](tp1/enunciado.pdf)    
- [Solution](/tp1/)

## Practical Work 2.The description and solution of the assignment:
Modeled with graphs. Graph traversal problems using DFS/BFS and AGM
- [Assignment](tp2/enunciado.pdf)    
- [Solution](/tp2/)

## Practical Work 3.The description and solution of the assignment:
Graph modeling, shortest path problems, maximum flow, and matching in bipartite graphs.
